        <h3>Some of the finer detail...</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h4>Competitive pricing</h4>
            <p>Our rates fluctuate so we are always trying to stay as
                competitive as possible depending on how busy the city is so
                we're more than happy to tailor a quote to suit your party size,
                the duration of your stay and your travel arrangements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h4>Cancellation, Deposits and Refunds</h4>
            <p>We understand that there may be acts of god, flight delays and
                adverse weather conditions out of your control. So; with
                individual bookings we're generally very flexible with
                cancellations and refunds as we realise we know what is around
                the corner and I don't want to take up your time reading a load
                of legal jargon that scares you have to death. Basically, if you
                book an apartment a few months in advance, have paid a 10%
                deposit and cancel last minute you can appreciate that we have
                turned away business in the interim so we will always endeavour
                to refund 100% if we can resell the apartment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h4>Security Deposit</h4>
            <p>If you do decide to book and confirm we will normally request a
                10% deposit and arrange a payment plan for the remainder that
                suits both parties. If you are staying long term again the same
                principal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h4>Long Term Contracts</h4>
            <p>We prefer that a lease or contract is signed if you know you
                will be in Belfast for a period longer than 6 months. If the
                nature of your work does not allow you to plan that far ahead a
                rolling month agreement can be arranged as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h4>Short Term Stays</h4>
            <p>No contract is required, just your signature on arrival. Just
                like a hotel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h4>Beat the quote or pricing around</h4>
            <p>Remember, if you find a better quote we strive to match if a
                similar facility and location; so feel free to give us a call
                and discuss a package or we're happy to organise a site visit,
                have a coffee at any of our locations before you book.</p>
