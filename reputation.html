        <p>Welcome to BT1 Apartments. A small family run business but big
            enough to care. My name is Terry Campbell and I operate BT1
            apartments - Belfast.</p>

        <p>I have worked within the hotel and hospitality sector since an early
            age and have worked in private country hotels, multinational global
            hotel players such as Hilton and Intercontinental Hotels. On my
            career journey I have managed the expectation and needs
            of... well everyone that you would expect to come through your
