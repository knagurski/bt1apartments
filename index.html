        <blockquote>Stayed at BT1 serviced apartments for 3 weeks whilst
            travelling around Northern Ireland. We were pleasantly surprised how
            fantastic the apartment facilities were, free WIFI in a central and
            convenient location. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and even spent
            a night with Terry & Ann (owners) at the fEILE Festival in Belfast.
            We will be back for sure on our return trip.

        <blockquote>Spent 6 months living here when working in Belfast and
            stayed at BT1 Apartments, Margarita Plaza. The apartment was crisp
            and clean, offered free WIFI which was great for business and was in
            a great location for walking to... well everywhere!

        <blockquote>Thanks Terry and Ann for looking after my every need when
            staying in Belfast on work. I wonâ€™t miss the Sunday night airport
            pickups especially during the cold winter nights! Thanks for
            everything and will be sure to call you when back in Belfast on
            business or leisure.
