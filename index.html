            <blockquote>The apartment was beautiful. Very close to the Titanic
                exhibition and easy access into the city centre for shopping and
                activities. Terry provided everything we needed for a lovely
                trip to Belfast! Highly recommend.

            <blockquote>This is a cozy, yet fairly spacious apartment for two
                with everything we needed. About a 15 minute walk to the city
                centre (city hall) but feels like a stroll by the river every
                time so it was actually very relaxing. Terry was super friendly
                and helpful. Highly recommend this place for a quiet stay, lets
                you see a bit more of Belfast than just the centre.

            <blockquote>Very nice to meet Terry who stayed on despite our delays
                so very grateful to him.

            <blockquote>The apartment was fantastic. It was a modern, open and
                warm apartment situated only about 15 minute walk from the city
                centre and around a 8 minute walk from the Europa Bus Station
                which makes it ideal for if you are planning on flying to
                Belfast. The apartment had towels and bedding included and the
                facilities are of a great quality. Would definitely stay again
                in this apartment.

            <blockquote>The apartment was brand new and immaculate. Location was
                good about 20 minutes walk to city centre. All bedding and
                towels supplied were great, hotel quality. Apartment was warm
                and shower excellent. Thank you!

            <blockquote>The Apartment was really nice and in a very handy
                location for getting into Belfast City Centre as well as other
                places in Northern Ireland. We were really comfortable and the
                amenities were all great. Terry was really helpful and was
                available any time we needed help with anything. We would really
                recommend this place if you're visiting Belfast.

            <blockquote>Thanks Terry and Ann for looking after my every need
                when staying in Belfast on work. I wonâ€™t miss the Sunday night
                airport pickups especially during the cold winter nights! Thanks
                for everything and will be sure to call you when back in Belfast
                on business or leisure.

            <blockquote>Spent 6 months living here when working in Belfast and
                stayed at BT1 Apartments, Margarita Plaza. The apartment was
                crisp and clean, offered free WIFI which was great for business
                and was in a great location for walking to... well everywhere!

            <blockquote>Stayed at BT1 serviced apartments for 3 weeks whilst
                travelling around Northern Ireland. We were pleasantly surprised
                how fantastic the apartment facilities were, free WIFI in a
                central and convenient location. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
                and even spent a night with Terry & Ann (owners) at the fEILE
                Festival in Belfast. We will be back for sure on our return
                trip.
